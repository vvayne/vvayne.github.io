        <title>Learning While Doing and a Minimalist Facebook Layout </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Initially, I had started making this website using Wordpress, but I’ve wanted to take time to actually learn HTML/CSS. So, based on a friend’s recommendation, I decided to use something called Jekyll. There was just enough HTML/CSS involved that I could start building my blog and see examples to understand what was happening.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I knew little HTML/CSS, my process of thinking while building the site was more or less like this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm, what does this do? I don’t know, let me search it up. Ah, so it does this. What about this? Why does it do this? What do multiple sources say? 
Let me try doing this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and gradually, like gaining momentum from pieces of a puzzle fitting together, my website was coming together. Understanding something and then doing it hands on is gratifying because you feel like you’re learning quickly. And I know I was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I recommend going to websites and using the browser’s developer tools to inspect elements and play with how they work. You can view the HTML and CSS all on the same window. Play with turning certain elements off and on or even inject the HTML/CSS with whatever you want it to do. Don’t know how something works? Look it up! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to get used to, but once you just play for a while, everything makes sense. And most importantly, it’s pretty fun!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-new-facebook-layout&quot;&gt;My New Facebook Layout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned enough CSS to restyle certain websites to fit my needs. I utilize the chrome extension “Stylish.” Using it, you can use other user made styles or create custom CSS styles that automatically apply to whatever website you want. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my fairly novice CSS knowledge, I went onto facebook and just started inspecting elements that I didn’t want to see on my news feed page anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end, I just ended up deleting everything from it except for the elements at the blue bar at the top. In the middle of the screen, I even learned how to put words of motivation so that I would be less distracted. A link to the layout is at the bottom of the post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This greatly decreased my time on facebook, so I’m happy with the practical results my CSS knowledge has given me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-forward&quot;&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have a couple of things I want to add to spruce up this site, but it’s been great learning as I go. 
More posts coming soon. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First Blog Post</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I’m relatively new to blogging. I don’t know what I plan to post on this website or how often I’ll do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do hope to contribute something not utterly useless though, whether it’s writing about something I recently learn or expressing thoughts about books or links I read. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This website is more or less still in construction though. I still want to add some things with javascript and maybe try other layouts that make my website more colorful or gives the user choices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this website is not optimized for mobile reading at all. This will have to change. For now though, this is what I have. I’ll be putting more posts here soon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, thanks for visiting!  &lt;/p&gt;
