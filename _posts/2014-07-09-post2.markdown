Okay, so I'm relatively new to blogging. I don't know what I plan to post on this website or how often I'll do it. 

I do hope to contribute something not utterly useless though, whether it's writing about something I recently learn or expressing thoughts about books or links I read. 

This website is more or less still in construction though. I still want to add some things with javascript and maybe try other layouts that make my website more colorful or gives the user choices. 

Additionally, this website is not optimized for mobile reading at all. This will have to change. For now though, this is what I have. I'll be putting more posts here soon. 

For now, thanks for visiting!
