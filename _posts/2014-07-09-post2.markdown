Okay, so I'm relatively new to this blogging thing. I don't know what I plan to post on this website or how often I'll do it. 

I do hope to contribute something valuable with my writing, whether it's by giving tutorials on something I've recently learned, expressing thoughts I have about books or links I read, and maybe even share tidbits of experiences I've learned from my own life. 

This website is more or less still in construction though. I still want to add some things with javascript and maybe try other layouts that make my website more colorful or gives the user choices. 

Additionally, this website is not optimized for mobile reading at all. This will have to change. For now though, I'm quite happy with what I have so far and hope to keep this going.
