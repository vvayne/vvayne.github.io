How to be Productive
=====================================

I started reading articles and books about being productive in high school. They always seemed interesting because it felt like the book contained secrets that would help me unlock the key to everything I ever wanted. 

Now, I can't stand articles about productivity anymore. They all seem to posit panaceas to all our woes in managing our time when in reality, what we use to stay organized doesn't need to be that complicated. 

It's as simple as just being present and being aware of what is important to you now and acting upon it. Yes, it's more complicated that it appears, but most productivity articles won't tell you that the hardest part about being productive is just following through and doing what you need to do. So no matter what they say about this method vs. another method, you still have to do what you gotta do in order to become productive.
