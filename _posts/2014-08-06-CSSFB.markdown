Update: I now have a chrome extension [!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minimal-distraction-free/kadeapmlliajjjkckobjffnogoffcjdh)

Initially, I had started making this website using Wordpress, but I wanted to learn some HTML/CSS. So, based on a friend's recommendation, I decided to use Jekyll and then further explore HTML/CSS as I was using Jekyll.

I knew little HTML/CSS, so my process of thinking while building like this: 

Hmm, what does this do? I don't know, let me search it up. Ah, so it does this. What about this? Why does it do this? What do multiple sources say? 

...and gradually, like gaining momentum from pieces of a puzzle fitting together, my website came together. 

Something else that helped was using the browser's developer tools to inspect elements in websites and play with how they work. You can view the HTML and CSS all on the same window. Play with turning certain elements off and on or even inject the HTML/CSS with whatever you want it to do. Don't know how something works? Look it up! 

It took me a while to get used to, but once you just play for a while, everything makes sense. And most importantly, it's pretty fun!  

##My New Facebook Layout##

I've learned enough CSS to restyle certain websites to fit my needs. Using the chrome extension "Stylish", you can use other user made styles or create custom CSS styles that automatically apply to whatever website you want. 

With my fairly novice CSS knowledge, I went onto facebook and just started inspecting elements that I didn't want to see on my news feed page anymore. 

At the end, I deleted everything from it except for the blue bar at the top. In the middle of the screen, I learned how to put words of motivation so that I would be less distracted. Here is the [link to the layout][1].

This greatly decreased my time on facebook, so I'm happy with the practical results my CSS knowledge has given me. 

##Moving Forward##

I still have a couple of things I want to add to spruce up this site, but it's been great learning as I go. 
More posts hopefully coming soon.
