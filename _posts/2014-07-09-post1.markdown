So I'm new to this whole website/ blog thing. I don't know what I plan to post or how often I'll do it. 

I do hope to contribute something not utterly useless though, whether it's writing about something I recently learn or expressing thoughts about books or links I read. 

This website is more or less still in construction though. I still want to add some things with javascript and maybe try other layouts that make my website more colorful or give the user choices. 

Additionally, this website is not optimized for mobile reading at all; this will have to change. 
I'll be putting more posts here soon though. 
Thanks for visiting.
